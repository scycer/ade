SOURCE: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/docs/get-started

LANGUAGE: Prompt
CODE:
```
Why is the ocean salty?
```

LANGUAGE: Text
CODE:
```
The ocean is salty due to several factors:

1. Weathering of rocks: Over millions of years, rain, rivers, and streams have eroded rocks containing mineral salts. These salts are carried into the ocean by water runoff.
2. Volcanic activity: Underwater volcanoes and hydrothermal vents release minerals, including salts, into the ocean water.
3. Atmospheric deposition: Salt particles from ocean spray can be carried by wind and deposited back into the ocean.
4. Evaporation: As water evaporates from the surface of the ocean, it leaves behind dissolved salts, increasing the concentration of salt in the remaining water.
5. Biological processes: Some marine organisms contribute to the ocean's salinity by releasing salt compounds as byproducts of their metabolism.

Over time, these processes have continuously added salts to the ocean, while evaporation removes pure water, leading to the ocean's current salinity levels. It's important to note that the total amount of salt in the ocean remains relatively stable because the input of salts is balanced by the removal of salts through processes like the formation of evaporite deposits.

```

LANGUAGE: Claude's Response
CODE:
```
Here’s the analysis of the customer feedback:

Issue: UI/UX
Sentiment: Negative
Priority: High
The customer is frustrated with the new dashboard design, which they find cluttered and slow to load. They specifically call out the missing “export” button, which is likely a critical feature. This issue needs to be addressed as a high priority.

Issue: Integration
Sentiment: Positive
Priority: Medium
The customer is pleased with the existing Salesforce integration but would like to see support for Hubspot as well. This is a feature request that could be considered for a future product update.

Issue: Pricing
Sentiment: Negative
Priority: High
The customer finds the pricing to be unreasonable, especially for the basic features. They are threatening to switch to a competitor, so this is a high-priority issue that needs to be reviewed.

Issue: Performance
Sentiment Negative
Priority: High
The customer is experiencing critical issues with the mobile app, where large file uploads consistently result in crashes. This is a significant problem that impacts the customer’s ability to use the product effectively and should be addressed as a high priority.

Issue: UI/UX
Sentiment: Positive
Priority: Low
The customer is overall satisfied with the product, specifically calling out the intuitive UI and excellent customer support. This is a positive piece of feedback that does not require any immediate action.

The 4-hour 37-minute disruption impacted our core file syncing service and admin dashboard, rendering them inaccessible. Additionally, the mobile app experienced partial functionality loss. Approximately 68% of our user base, totaling 1.3 million users, were affected. Based on our Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and average revenue per user, we estimate a financial impact of $420,000 in service credits and potential customer churn.

TITLE: Configure OpenTelemetry for Claude Code
DESCRIPTION: This snippet provides a quick start guide to configure OpenTelemetry for Claude Code using environment variables. It covers enabling telemetry, selecting metrics and logs exporters (OTLP, Prometheus, console), setting the OTLP endpoint and protocol, configuring authentication headers, and adjusting export intervals for debugging purposes. It also notes the default export intervals and advises resetting them for production.

SOURCE: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/docs/claude-code/monitoring-usage

LANGUAGE: Shell
CODE:
```
# 1. Enable telemetry
export CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY=1

# 2. Choose exporters (both are optional - configure only what you need)
export OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=otlp       # Options: otlp, prometheus, console
export OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER=otlp          # Options: otlp, console

# 3. Configure OTLP endpoint (for OTLP exporter)
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317

# 4. Set authentication (if required)
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="Authorization=Bearer your-token"

# 5. For debugging: reduce export intervals
export OTEL_METRIC_EXPORT_INTERVAL=10000  # 10 seconds (default: 60000ms)
export OTEL_LOGS_EXPORT_INTERVAL=5000     # 5 seconds (default: 5000ms)

# 6. Run Claude Code

TITLE: Financial Analysis without Step-by-Step Thinking
DESCRIPTION: This example demonstrates Claude's financial analysis capabilities when not explicitly instructed to think step-by-step. The recommendation is reasonable but lacks detailed quantification and consideration of historical market performance, leading to a less informed decision.

SOURCE: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/chain-of-thought

LANGUAGE: User Prompt
CODE:
```
You’re a financial advisor. A client wants to invest $10,000. They can choose between two options: A) A stock that historically returns 12% annually but is volatile, or B) A bond that guarantees 6% annually. The client needs the money in 5 years for a down payment on a house. Which option do you recommend?
```

LANGUAGE: Assistant Response
CODE:
```
Based on the information provided, I would recommend option B, the bond that guarantees a 6% annual return. Here’s why:  1. Certainty: The bond offers a guaranteed 6% annual return, which provides certainty in financial planning. This is crucial when the client has a specific financial goal (down payment) with a fixed timeline (5 years). 2. Risk aversion: Since the client needs this money for an important life event (buying a house), they likely have a low risk tolerance. The volatility of the stock market could jeopardize their plans if there’s a downturn close to when they need the funds. 3. Time horizon: With only 5 years, there’s less time to recover from potential stock market downturns. Longer investment horizons (10+ years) are generally better suited for weathering stock market volatility.  While the stock’s historical 12% return is attractive, past performance doesn’t guarantee future results. The guaranteed 6% from the bond ensures the client will have the funds they need when it’s time to make the down payment.

TITLE: Configure File Protection Hook for Claude Tools
DESCRIPTION: This configuration snippet defines a `PreToolUse` hook that prevents Claude tools from editing sensitive files. It uses a Python command to check if the `file_path` in the tool input contains any of the specified sensitive patterns like `.env`, `package-lock.json`, or `.git/`. If a sensitive file is detected, the command exits with a non-zero status (2), blocking the operation.

TITLE: Claude Tool Use Mechanism and Integration Steps
DESCRIPTION: Detailed explanation of how tool use works with Claude, covering client and server tool types, and the four-step process for integrating and executing client tools.

SOURCE: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview

LANGUAGE: APIDOC
CODE:
```
How tool use works:
  Claude supports two types of tools:
    1. Client tools: Execute on your systems.
       - User-defined custom tools.
       - Anthropic-defined tools (e.g., computer use, text editor) requiring client implementation.
    2. Server tools: Execute on Anthropic’s servers (e.g., web search tool).
       - Specified in API request, no client implementation needed.
  Anthropic-defined tools use versioned types (e.g., web_search_20250305).

  Client tools integration steps:
    1. Provide Claude with tools and a user prompt:
       - Define client tools (name, description, input schemas) in API request.
       - Include user prompt.
    2. Claude decides to use a tool:
       - Claude assesses if tools can help.
       - Constructs a tool use request.
       - API response has `stop_reason` of `tool_use` for client tools.
    3. Execute the tool and return results:
       - Extract tool name and input from Claude’s request.
       - Execute tool code on your system.
       - Return results in a new `user` message with a `tool_result` content block.
    4. Claude uses tool result to formulate a response:
       - Claude analyzes tool results to craft final response.
  Note: Steps 3 and 4 are optional; tool use request (step 2) might be sufficient.
```

TITLE: Send Multiple Images to Claude API with System Prompt (Base64)
DESCRIPTION: This Python snippet illustrates how to send multiple Base64-encoded images to the Claude API while also providing a system prompt. The system prompt allows developers to set a specific behavior or instruction for the model, such as requiring responses in a particular language, before processing the user's image-based query.

TITLE: Constructing the Claude API tool use system prompt template
DESCRIPTION: This template illustrates how Anthropic constructs the system prompt when the `tools` parameter is used in an API request. It combines formatting instructions, JSON Schema tool definitions, any user-specified system prompt, and tool configuration to provide the necessary context for the model to operate properly.

SOURCE: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/implement-tool-use

LANGUAGE: APIDOC
CODE:
```
In this environment you have access to a set of tools you can use to answer the user's question.
{{ FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS }}
String and scalar parameters should be specified as is, while lists and objects should use JSON format. Note that spaces for string values are not stripped. The output is not expected to be valid XML and is parsed with regular expressions.
Here are the functions available in JSONSchema format:
{{ TOOL DEFINITIONS IN JSON SCHEMA }}
{{ USER SYSTEM PROMPT }}
{{ TOOL CONFIGURATION }}

TITLE: Financial Analysis with Step-by-Step Thinking
DESCRIPTION: This example illustrates how instructing Claude to 'think step-by-step' leads to a more comprehensive and justifiable financial analysis. The assistant calculates exact figures, considers historical market volatility, and deeply analyzes the client’s risk tolerance, resulting in a more confident recommendation.

SOURCE: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/chain-of-thought

LANGUAGE: User Prompt
CODE:
```
You’re a financial advisor. A client wants to invest $10,000. They can choose between two options: A) A stock that historically returns 12% annually but is volatile, or B) A bond that guarantees 6% annually. The client needs the money in 5 years for a down payment on a house. Which option do you recommend? Think step-by-step.
```

LANGUAGE: Assistant Response
CODE:
```
To determine the best investment option for our client, I’ll consider several factors step-by-step:  <thinking> 1. Understand the client’s goal and timeline:  - Goal: Down payment for a house  - Timeline: 5 years  - Implication: This is a short-term, high-priority financial goal. The client likely cannot afford significant risk or volatility.  2. Analyze Option A (Stock):  - Pro: Higher historical return (12% annually)  - Con: Volatile (implying potential for significant gains or losses)  - Calculate potential 5-year return:  - Best case (12% annually): $10,000 * (1.12)^5 ≈ $17,623.42  - Worst case (market crash): Could lose a substantial portion, e.g., 50% crash = $5,000  3. Analyze Option B (Bond):  - Pro: Guaranteed return (6% annually)  - Con: Lower return compared to historical stock performance  - Calculate 5-year return:  - Guaranteed: $10,000 * (1.06)^5 ≈ $13,382.25  4. Consider risk tolerance:  - Goal is a house down payment (essential, not discretionary)  - Short timeline (5 years) limits ability to recover from market downturns  - Conclusion: Client likely has low risk tolerance  5. Historical perspective:  - Stock’s 12% is historical, not guaranteed  - In 5-year periods, stock market can vary wildly:  - 2003-2007 (pre-financial crisis): S&P 500 up ~82%  - 2007-2011 (during crisis): S&P 500 down ~2%  - Conclusion: Past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, especially short-term  6. Final analysis:  - Option A (Stock): Higher potential return but unacceptable risk of not meeting the down payment goal  - Option B (Bond): Guaranteed to meet ~80% of best-case stock scenario, 100% certainty of having funds </thinking>  <answer> I recommend Option B, the bond with a guaranteed 6% annual return. While the stock’s historical 12% return is tempting, the bond ensures you’ll have $13,382.25 in 5 years for your house down payment. Given the importance and short timeline of your goal, the stock’s volatility poses an unacceptable risk. The bond provides certainty, which is invaluable for such a crucial financial milestone. </answer>

TITLE: Claude Chain of Thought Prompt for Tool Use
DESCRIPTION: A recommended prompt for Claude Sonnet and Haiku models to encourage pre-tool call analysis, ensuring tools are used appropriately and preventing calls with missing required parameters. It guides the model to think within `<thinking>` tags before making a tool call.

SOURCE: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview

LANGUAGE: Text
CODE:
```
Answer the user's request using relevant tools (if they are available). Before calling a tool, do some analysis within <thinking></thinking> tags. First, think about which of the provided tools is the relevant tool to answer the user's request. Second, go through each of the required parameters of the relevant tool and determine if the user has directly provided or given enough information to infer a value. When deciding if the parameter can be inferred, carefully consider all the context to see if it supports a specific value. If all of the required parameters are present or can be reasonably inferred, close the thinking tag and proceed with the tool call. BUT, if one of the values for a required parameter is missing, DO NOT invoke the function (not even with fillers for the missing params) and instead, ask the user to provide the missing parameters. DO NOT ask for more information on optional parameters if it is not provided.

4. Implement minimal fix
5. Verify solution works

Debugging process:
- Analyze error messages and logs
- Check recent code changes
- Form and test hypotheses
- Add strategic debug logging
- Inspect variable states

For each issue, provide:
- Root cause explanation
- Evidence supporting the diagnosis
- Specific code fix
- Testing approach
- Prevention recommendations

Focus on fixing the underlying issue, not just symptoms.

TITLE: AI Prompt for Strategy Document Evaluation
DESCRIPTION: Illustrates a structured prompt for an AI to grade a strategy review document based on specific criteria (clarity, actionability, enterprise alignment) and provides an example of a detailed AI-generated evaluation.

SOURCE: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/chain-prompts

LANGUAGE: Prompt
CODE:
```
Grade this strategy review document for clarity, actionability, and alignment with enterprise priorities.   <priorities> {{PRIORITIES}} </priorities>  <strategy_doc> {{STRATEGY_DOC}} </strategy_doc>
```

LANGUAGE: AI Response
CODE:
```
1. Clarity: A
  + Clear structure with Executive Summary, Detailed Analysis, and Recommendations.
  + Analysis uses a grading system (B+, B-) for quick grasp of strengths/weaknesses.
  + Technical terms (RBAC, ABAC, TLS) are explained or contextualized, aiding non-technical leadership.
  + Visual aids (bullet points, indentation) enhance readability.
  2. Actionability: A-
  + Recommendations are specific and technical (e.g., “Implement auto-scaling with Kubernetes”).
  + PoC plan with clear objectives provides a roadmap.
  + Missing: Timelines, resource requirements, or team assignments for each recommendation.
  + Consider: Add a “Next Steps” section with immediate actions, roles, and a high-level timeline.
  3. Enterprise Alignment: A+
  + Directly addresses enterprise priorities:
  - Scalability: Discusses handling enterprise-level traffic spikes.
  - Security: Focuses on data isolation, encryption, and enterprise IAM.
  - Cost: Strategies align with enterprise FinOps (reserved instances, right-sizing).
  + PoC with “high-scale simulation” and security audit shows commitment to enterprise-grade quality.
  + Language resonates with enterprise concerns: “unacceptable risk,” “enterprise-grade,” “instill confidence.”
  Overall, the document excels in clarity and enterprise alignment. The actionability is strong but could be elevated to A+ with a “Next Steps” section. The technical depth, coupled with clear explanations, makes this highly effective for both technical and non-technical leadership. Great work!

    description: Billing and rate-limit usage. Anthropic's API bills and rate-limits by token counts, as tokens represent the underlying cost to our systems. Under the hood, the API transforms requests into a format suitable for the model. The model's output then goes through a parsing stage before becoming an API response. As a result, the token counts in `usage` will not match one-to-one with the exact visible content of an API request or response. For example, `output_tokens` will be non-zero, even for an empty string response from Claude. Total input tokens in a request is the summation of `input_tokens`, `cache_creation_input_tokens`, and `cache_read_input_tokens`.

TITLE: Preserve Thinking Blocks in Multi-Turn Tool Use with Claude API
DESCRIPTION: This example illustrates how to maintain conversational context when using extended thinking with tools over multiple turns. It shows how to extract `thinking` and `tool_use` blocks from an initial Claude response and then re-include them in the `messages` array of a subsequent API call, ensuring Claude retains its internal reasoning and tool interaction history.

SOURCE: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/docs/claude_api_primer

LANGUAGE: python
CODE:
```
# First request - Claude responds with thinking and tool request
response = client.messages.create(

    max_tokens=16000,
    thinking={
        "type": "enabled",
        "budget_tokens": 10000
    },
    tools=[weather_tool],
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in Paris?"}
    ]
)

# Extract thinking block and tool use block
thinking_block = next((block for block in response.content
                      if block.type == 'thinking'), None)
tool_use_block = next((block for block in response.content
                      if block.type == 'tool_use'), None)

# Second request - Include thinking block and tool result
continuation = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    max_tokens=16000,
    thinking={

TITLE: Claude's Image Understanding Limitations
DESCRIPTION: This section details the known limitations of Claude's image understanding capabilities, including restrictions on people identification, potential inaccuracies with low-quality images, limited spatial reasoning, approximate counting, inability to detect AI-generated images, refusal to process inappropriate content, and unsuitability for complex medical diagnostics.

SOURCE: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/docs/build-with-claude/vision

LANGUAGE: APIDOC
CODE:
```
* People identification: Claude [cannot be used](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup) to identify (i.e., name) people in images and will refuse to do so.
* Accuracy: Claude may hallucinate or make mistakes when interpreting low-quality, rotated, or very small images under 200 pixels.
* Spatial reasoning: Claude’s spatial reasoning abilities are limited. It may struggle with tasks requiring precise localization or layouts, like reading an analog clock face or describing exact positions of chess pieces.
* Counting: Claude can give approximate counts of objects in an image but may not always be precisely accurate, especially with large numbers of small objects.
* AI generated images: Claude does not know if an image is AI-generated and may be incorrect if asked. Do not rely on it to detect fake or synthetic images.
* Inappropriate content: Claude will not process inappropriate or explicit images that violate our [Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup).
* Healthcare applications: While Claude can analyze general medical images, it is not designed to interpret complex diagnostic scans such as CTs or MRIs. Claude’s outputs should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice or diagnosis.

TITLE: Configuring Claude Code Permissions
DESCRIPTION: Describes how to view and manage Claude Code's tool permissions using the `/permissions` command. It explains the different rule types (Allow, Ask, Deny), the concept of additional directories for extended file access, and the role of the default mode in controlling permission behavior for new requests.

SOURCE: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/iam

LANGUAGE: APIDOC
CODE:
```
Configuring Claude Code Permissions:

- Access via `/permissions` command to view & manage rules.
- Rules are sourced from `settings.json`.

Rule Types:
- **Allow**: Permits tool usage without manual approval.
- **Ask**: Prompts for confirmation on tool use (takes precedence over Allow).
- **Deny**: Prevents tool usage (takes precedence over Allow and Ask).

Additional Settings:
- **Additional directories**: Extends file access beyond the initial working directory.
- **Default mode**: Controls permission behavior for new requests.

Rule Format:
- `Tool` or `Tool(optional-specifier)`
- Example: Adding `Bash` to allow rules permits Bash tool usage without approval.

  - Issue: Vendor has broad rights to use client data for “service improvement.”
  - Risk: Could lead to unauthorized data sharing or monetization.
2. SLAs (Section 5):
  - Issue: 99.5% uptime guarantee is below industry standard.
  - Risk: Excessive downtime could impact our operations.
3. Liability (Section 9):
  - Issue: Cap set at 3 months of fees.
  - Risk: Inadequate for potential data breaches or service failures.

Draft email:

Dear {{VENDOR}},

After reviewing the SaaS agreement, we have concerns:

1. Data Privacy: We require that our data only be used for direct service provision, not broad “service improvement.” Please amend Section 7.
2. SLAs: 99.5% uptime is insufficient. We need 99.99% with clearly defined penalties. Please revise Section 5.
3. Liability: The current cap of 3 months’ fees is inadequate. We propose a cap of 12 months’ fees, with no cap for data breaches or willful misconduct.

We value our potential partnership and believe these changes will set us up for success. Please send a revised agreement.

Best regards, {{CLO\_NAME}}
