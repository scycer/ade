# Development Environment
The app is already running in a container on port 6969. Access it at http://localhost:6969
No need to run `bun dev` or similar commands - the dev server is already active.

# Validating code changes
@app/validation-report.txt will always have the last complete run of the validation of the codebase (test, types, compiles)
