# Task: Create a Simple CLI Tool

Create a simple Bun-based CLI tool that:

1. Create a new file called `hello-cli.ts` that:
   - Takes a name argument from the command line
   - Prints a personalized greeting
   - Shows the current date and time
   - Uses proper TypeScript types

2. Make the script executable with a shebang

3. Add error handling for missing arguments

4. Create a simple test file `hello-cli.test.ts` that verifies the functionality

Please complete all steps and ensure the code is working correctly.
