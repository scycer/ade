# Task: Analyze Project Structure

<!-- This is a more complex task example -->

Analyze the current project structure and:

1. **Scan the codebase**
   - List all TypeScript files in the experiments folder
   - Count the total number of experiment files
   - Identify which experiments use MCP servers

2. **Create a summary report**
   - Generate a file called `project-analysis.md` with:
     - Total number of experiments
     - List of unique SDK features used across experiments
     - Which files demonstrate session management
     - Which files show permission modes

3. **Identify patterns**
   - Find common imports across experiment files
   - List the most frequently used SDK methods

4. **Document findings**
   - Create a concise summary of the SDK capabilities
   - Note any interesting patterns or best practices observed

Please be thorough in your analysis and create well-formatted documentation.
