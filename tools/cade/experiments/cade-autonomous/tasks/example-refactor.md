# Task: Refactor Code for Better Organization

Refactor the `cade-agent.ts` file to improve its organization:

1. **Extract utilities**
   - Create a new file `utils/session-manager.ts` with session-related functions
   - Move `SessionResult` interface and session functions there
   - Export them properly

2. **Create configuration module**
   - Create `config/agent-config.ts` with all configuration
   - Make configuration more flexible with environment variables
   - Add validation for configuration values

3. **Improve logging**
   - Create `utils/logger.ts` with better logging functions
   - Add log levels (INFO, WARN, ERROR)
   - Include timestamps in logs

4. **Update main file**
   - Import from new modules
   - Ensure everything still works
   - Add JSDoc comments to exported functions

5. **Test the refactored code**
   - Verify the agent still runs correctly
   - Ensure all imports are working

Complete all refactoring steps and ensure the code is cleaner and more maintainable.
