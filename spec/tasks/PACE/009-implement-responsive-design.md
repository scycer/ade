# Task 009: Implement Responsive Design for Tablets

## Outcome
The PACE visualization works seamlessly on tablet devices with touch-optimized controls and adaptive layouts.

## Files to Modify
- `app/src/components/pace/index.tsx` - Add responsive breakpoints
- `app/src/components/pace/graph-controls.tsx` - Touch-friendly controls
- `app/src/components/pace/file-preview.tsx` - Adaptive panel sizing

## Implementation Details
1. Touch interactions:
   - Pinch to zoom support
   - Touch and drag for panning
   - Tap to select nodes
   - Long press for context menu
   - Swipe gestures for panels

2. Responsive breakpoints:
   - Desktop: > 1024px (full features)
   - Tablet landscape: 768px - 1024px
   - Tablet portrait: 600px - 767px
   - Mobile: < 600px (basic view)

3. Tablet-specific adjustments:
   - Larger touch targets (min 44px)
   - Simplified control panel
   - Bottom sheet style for file preview
   - Floating action button for controls
   - Gesture hints on first use

4. Layout adaptations:
   - File preview: Full screen overlay on tablets
   - Controls: Floating bubbles instead of panel
   - Statistics: Swipeable bottom sheet
   - Search: Full screen modal

5. Performance optimizations:
   - Reduce node count on smaller screens
   - Simpler node rendering (less detail)
   - Debounced interactions
   - Lower animation complexity
   - Progressive detail loading

6. Orientation handling:
   - Adjust layout on orientation change
   - Maintain zoom level appropriately
   - Reposition floating elements
   - Show/hide elements based on space

## Success Criteria
- Works on iPad/tablet browsers
- All interactions possible with touch
- No elements too small to tap
- Smooth performance on tablet hardware
- Orientation changes handled gracefully
