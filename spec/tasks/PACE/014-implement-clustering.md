# Task 014: Implement Module Clustering

## Outcome
Group related files into visual clusters representing modules or features, making the graph more organized and easier to understand.

## Files to Create
- `app/src/lib/pace/cluster-detector.ts` - Clustering algorithms
- `app/src/components/pace/cluster-view.tsx` - Cluster visualization

## Files to Modify
- `app/src/components/pace/index.tsx` - Add clustering mode
- `app/src/components/pace/graph-config.ts` - Cluster styling

## Implementation Details
1. Clustering algorithms:
   - Directory-based clustering (by folder structure)
   - Dependency-based clustering (strongly connected)
   - Feature-based clustering (by naming patterns)
   - Component-based clustering (UI components)
   - Service-based clustering (API/services)

2. Visual representation:
   - Colored backgrounds for clusters
   - Dashed borders around groups
   - Cluster labels
   - Collapsible cluster nodes
   - Nested cluster support

3. Interaction features:
   - Expand/collapse clusters
   - Drag entire clusters
   - Cluster-level operations
   - Inter-cluster dependency lines
   - Cluster statistics

4. Automatic detection:
   - Identify natural module boundaries
   - Detect feature folders
   - Group by file naming conventions
   - Recognize common patterns
   - Suggest cluster improvements

5. Manual adjustment:
   - Drag nodes between clusters
   - Create custom clusters
   - Name/rename clusters
   - Set cluster colors
   - Save cluster configurations

6. Cluster analysis:
   - Coupling between clusters
   - Cohesion within clusters
   - Cluster complexity metrics
   - Dependency direction analysis
   - Circular dependency detection

## Success Criteria
- Clusters clearly visible
- Automatic detection accurate
- Smooth expand/collapse animations
- Performance with nested clusters
- Improved graph readability
