# Task 015: Add Performance Monitoring

## Outcome
Monitor and optimize the visualization's performance, especially with large codebases, ensuring smooth interactions and identifying bottlenecks.

## Files to Create
- `app/src/lib/pace/performance-monitor.ts` - Performance tracking
- `app/src/components/pace/performance-overlay.tsx` - Debug overlay

## Files to Modify
- `app/src/components/pace/index.tsx` - Integrate monitoring

## Implementation Details
1. Performance metrics:
   - FPS counter
   - Render time per frame
   - Node count vs performance
   - Memory usage
   - CPU usage percentage

2. Debug overlay:
   - Toggle with keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+P)
   - Semi-transparent HUD
   - Real-time metric updates
   - Graph performance history
   - Bottleneck indicators

3. Optimization triggers:
   - Auto-reduce quality when FPS drops
   - Progressive node loading
   - Level-of-detail rendering
   - Viewport culling
   - Edge bundling for many connections

4. Performance profiling:
   - Record performance sessions
   - Identify slow operations
   - Memory leak detection
   - Interaction response times
   - Export performance reports

5. Adaptive rendering:
   - Adjust based on device capability
   - Dynamic quality settings
   - Automatic complexity reduction
   - Smart caching strategies
   - Lazy evaluation of expensive operations

6. Alerts and warnings:
   - High memory usage warning
   - Slow render alert
   - Too many nodes warning
   - Suggest optimizations
   - Performance tips

## Success Criteria
- Maintains 60fps with 200+ nodes
- Memory usage stays under control
- Automatic optimizations work
- Performance data exportable
- No impact when monitoring disabled
