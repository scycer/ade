# Task 013: Add Real-time File Change Detection

## Outcome
The graph automatically updates when files in the codebase are modified, added, or deleted, showing real-time changes in the project structure.

## Files to Create
- `app/src/lib/pace/file-watcher.ts` - File system monitoring
- `app/src/lib/pace/graph-updater.ts` - Incremental graph updates
- `app/src/lib/pace/change-animator.ts` - Animate graph changes

## Files to Modify
- `app/src/components/pace/index.tsx` - Integrate file watching

## Implementation Details
1. File watching setup:
   - Monitor app/src directory
   - Detect file changes (create, modify, delete)
   - Debounce rapid changes
   - Ignore temporary files
   - Handle file move/rename

2. Change detection:
   - File content changes
   - Import/export modifications
   - New dependencies added
   - Dependencies removed
   - File type changes

3. Graph update strategy:
   - Incremental updates (not full rescan)
   - Diff calculation for changes
   - Preserve user's view position
   - Maintain selected nodes
   - Update statistics in real-time

4. Visual feedback:
   - Pulse animation for modified files
   - Fade in for new files
   - Fade out for deleted files
   - Edge animations for new dependencies
   - Color changes for modified nodes

5. Change history:
   - Timeline of recent changes
   - Ability to replay changes
   - Change highlighting toggle
   - Filter by change type
   - Undo/redo capability

6. Performance optimization:
   - Batch updates for multiple changes
   - Throttle animation updates
   - Lazy loading for large changes
   - Background processing
   - Memory management for history

## Success Criteria
- Changes detected within 1 second
- Graph updates smoothly
- No lag during rapid changes
- User interactions preserved
- Memory usage remains stable
