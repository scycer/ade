# Task 003: Create Cytoscape Container

## Outcome
A fully functional Cytoscape.js graph container that renders and is ready to display nodes and edges representing the codebase structure.

## Files to Modify
- `app/src/components/pace/index.tsx` - Add Cytoscape initialization and container

## Implementation Details
1. Set up React refs for the Cytoscape container
2. Create useEffect hook for Cytoscape initialization
3. Configure basic Cytoscape instance with:
   - Container element reference
   - Initial empty elements array
   - Basic styling for nodes and edges
   - Default layout (start with 'grid' for testing)
   - Viewport settings (zoom limits, panning)

4. Container requirements:
   - Full height of available space (100vh minus header)
   - Full width of content area
   - Background color that contrasts with nodes
   - Proper cleanup on component unmount

5. Add basic mock data for testing:
   - Create 5-10 test nodes representing files
   - Create edges representing dependencies
   - Use different colors for different file types

## Success Criteria
- Graph container renders without errors
- Mock nodes and edges are visible
- Graph is interactive (pan, zoom, select)
- No memory leaks on component unmount
- Responsive to window resizing
