# PACE - Progressive Analysis of Codebase Evolution

## Overview
PACE is an experimental visualization tool for understanding and navigating complex codebases through interactive dependency graphs. It provides real-time insights into code structure, dependencies, and evolution patterns.

## Core Concept
The main goal is to visualize the "sheer volume of information changing in a codebase environment" by creating an interactive, real-time graph visualization that shows:
- File relationships and dependencies
- Code structure and organization
- Real-time changes as they happen
- Complexity hotspots and patterns

## Task Execution Order

### Phase 1: Foundation (Tasks 1-3)
1. **001-install-dependencies.md** - Set up required npm packages
2. **002-create-pace-route.md** - Add PACE to app navigation
3. **003-create-cytoscape-container.md** - Create basic graph container

### Phase 2: Data Integration (Tasks 4-5)
4. **004-implement-file-scanner.md** - Build codebase scanning logic
5. **005-integrate-real-data.md** - Connect real data to visualization

### Phase 3: Interactivity (Tasks 6-8)
6. **006-add-graph-controls.md** - Add user controls for graph
7. **007-implement-file-preview.md** - Show file contents on click
8. **008-add-graph-statistics.md** - Display codebase metrics

### Phase 4: Enhanced UX (Tasks 9-11)
9. **009-implement-responsive-design.md** - Tablet/mobile support
10. **010-create-ai-chat-window.md** - Floating AI assistant window
11. **011-add-avatar-sprites.md** - Animated assistant avatar

### Phase 5: Intelligence (Tasks 12-13)
12. **012-implement-ai-integration.md** - Connect AI for assistance
13. **013-add-realtime-updates.md** - Live file change detection

### Phase 6: Advanced Features (Tasks 14-15)
14. **014-implement-clustering.md** - Group related files visually
15. **015-add-performance-monitoring.md** - Optimize for large codebases

## Key Features
- **Interactive Graph**: Pan, zoom, and explore the codebase structure
- **Real-time Updates**: See changes as they happen in the codebase
- **File Preview**: Click any node to see file contents and details
- **AI Assistant**: Get help understanding code and navigating
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Performance Optimized**: Handles large codebases smoothly

## Technical Stack
- **Visualization**: Cytoscape.js for graph rendering
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Build**: Bun runtime and bundler
- **AI Integration**: Context-aware assistant

## Success Metrics
- Visualizes entire ADE codebase structure
- Maintains 60fps with 200+ nodes
- Responsive on tablet devices
- AI provides helpful navigation assistance
- Real-time updates within 1 second of file changes

## Implementation Notes
Each task file contains:
- Clear outcome definition
- Files to create/modify
- Detailed implementation steps
- Success criteria

Tasks are designed to be:
- Self-contained and focused
- Incrementally testable
- Clear enough for AI agents to implement
- Building towards the complete vision
