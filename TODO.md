# FOCUS
Start with what I don’t have now, a way to visualise the sheer volume of information changing in a codebase enviroment.

- [ ]  Node graph of ade codebase
    - [ ]  Mock the UI first
    - [ ]  Do a dependancy graph extract to get more info
    - [ ]  Try showing a file clicked in the graph
    - [ ]  Does it work on tablet?
    - [ ]  Could i put a AI chat floating window? That can “sticky” to side? That has a girl talking to you? I have the sprites

# ADE Skill progression
- Read a file and show on UI
- Clone a repo/worktree (Git SSH key needed)
- Use Claude code


# IDEAS
- Repo skeleton
- Dynamic MCP server for Claude Code
- Demo repo to work on (Mini games for kids)
